# Empower your docs with Read the Docs

This repository contains a self-contained JavaScript client that will empower your docs,
elevating them to the next level ðŸš€.
All these features are enabled by default _just_ by hosting your documentation in Read the Docs.

## Features

## Local Development

- Make sure you have the correct version of Node.js installed (>= 18). You can use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for easier management of different Node.js versions.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the local dev server. While this can run without a local Read the Docs development instance, not everything will work.
- Run `npm test` to run the test suite, using web-test-runner. You can run also `npm run test:dev` to leave tests running in watch mode or `npm run test:debug` to manually test the suite in a browser.

## Deployment

Deploy documentation is available in our published docs here: https://readthedocs-addons.readthedocs.io/releasing.html

## Development guidelines

### Element attributes

- Don't use CSS classes on web component elements, these have tended to conflict with parent DOM styles. If needed, use CSS selectors against web component attributes like `:host[position="inline"]` instead.
- When adding an attribute on a custom web components, don't use `data` prefixed attributes, for example `<readthedocs-flyout position="inline">`.
- When using a custom attribute on a native element, do use `data` prefixed attributes, for example `<div data-position="inline">`.

### CSS variables

We use CSS variables to provide end users and theme maintainers with some light control of element styling of the inner shadow DOM elements.
Variables have several layers of prefixing/inheritance, as shown here using `font-size` as an example:

- `--readthedocs-font-size`: This can be set at `html`/`:root` in the parent DOM to affect font size on all of our elements.
- `--readthedocs-flyout-font-size`: This can be set at `html`/`:root` in the parent DOM to affect font size on only the flyout element.
- `--addons-flyout-font-size`: This is an inner variable used by the addon shadow DOM CSS. It's set inside each addon `:host` CSS selector to give a default value to `--readthedocs-flyout-font-size` without overriding a user supplied value for this variable.
